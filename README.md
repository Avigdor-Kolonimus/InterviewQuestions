# InterviewQuestions
Interview questions I was asked.
### Flood Fill
Flood fill, also called seed fill, is a flooding algorithm that determines and alters the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array 
with some matching attribute. It is used in the "bucket" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, 
and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. Implemented two methods: recursive(BFS) and stack-based.

- `go run floodfill.go`

### Lexicographically largest subsequence containing all distinct characters only once
Given a string S, the task is to find the lexicographically largest subsequence that can be formed using all distinct characters only once from the given string.
